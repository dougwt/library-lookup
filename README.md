library-lookup
===============
---
A Python module I wrote to retrieve a [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) member’s “to-read” shelf and check to see if the books are available from either the Kindle Owner’s Lending Library or the King County Library System‘s eBook collections.

Configuration
---------------
Rename *librarylookup.example.cfg* to *librarylookup.cfg* and replace the information with your own API keys for each service.
